# SPAM Detection PoC

This is a proof-of-concept program for detecting spam messages based on a scoring system that analyzes the message's content for specific keywords and links associated with spam.

## Features

- Set an API key for using the spam detection service
- Input text messages and get a spam score
- Remove API key

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Set your API key by clicking on the "Set API Key" button and entering your API key.
3. Enter a message to check for spam and click on the "Check" button.
4. The program will display a spam score for the message based on the presence of certain keywords and links.
5. If you no longer wish to use the program with an API key, click on the "Remove API Key" button.

## Limitations

This program is a proof-of-concept and may not be 100% accurate in detecting spam messages. It is also limited to analyzing text-based messages and does not support image or multimedia analysis.

## Future Work

In the future, this program could be extended to incorporate machine learning algorithms for more accurate spam detection. It could also be developed into a full-fledged spam-blocking service that intercepts messages before they reach their intended recipients.
